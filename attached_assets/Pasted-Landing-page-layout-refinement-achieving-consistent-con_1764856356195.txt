Landing page layout refinement - achieving consistent content width and proportional scaling across all sections.

CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:
The hero and sub-hero sections currently use approximately 70% of the screen width with proper margins on both sides. All sections below must match this exact width constraint. Currently, the dashboard and process sections are stretching to nearly 100% width, which breaks visual consistency. We need to scale these sections down proportionally - reducing both WIDTH and HEIGHT together - to maintain elegant proportions while achieving layout harmony.


GLOBAL LAYOUT RULES:

1. Width Consistency (PRIMARY ISSUE):
   - Measure the max-width of your hero section (the "From Keywords to Intent" dark section)
   - Apply this EXACT same max-width container to every section below
   - All sections must be centered with equal left/right margins
   - No section should stretch wider than ~70% of viewport width
   - This creates a consistent vertical content column

2. Proportional Scaling:
   - When reducing size, reduce both width AND height together
   - Scale content down uniformly (like zooming out) rather than squeezing only one dimension
   - Maintain aspect ratios and visual balance
   - Think of this as applying a 0.8x or 0.85x transform to oversized sections


SECTION-BY-SECTION FIXES:

SECTION 1: "No More Google Search for Best Brands" + Floating Question Cards

Current state: Light background section with heading and two question cards below it.

Fixes needed:
- Apply the standard max-width container (same as hero - approximately 70% of screen width)
- Keep the heading "No More Google Search for Best Brands" at its current size and spacing
- For the floating question cards below the heading:
  * Reduce the vertical spacing (padding) between the heading and cards to 40-50px
  * Reduce the bottom padding of this section to 40-50px
  * The cards themselves should stay at comfortable readable sizes
  * Do NOT add any new spacing above the heading
- Content width: Must match hero width exactly


SECTION 2: "Category Leader Performance" Analytics Dashboard

Current state: Dark background section with metrics stretched nearly full-width across screen.

Fixes needed:
- This section is currently TOO WIDE (near 100% width vs hero's 70%)
- Apply the standard max-width container to constrain this entire dark section to hero width
- This will automatically make the section narrower with proper margins on left/right
- Once width is constrained, scale all internal elements proportionally:
  * The 4 metric cards (86, 12,400, +340%, Leader) should scale down in both dimensions
  * Reduce card width by constraining container + reduce internal padding by 20-25%
  * Reduce card height by decreasing internal vertical padding by 20-25%
  * Keep typography readable but scale everything proportionally
- Below the main metrics:
  * "Platform Execution" and "Competitive Position" subsections also scale down proportionally
  * Reduce vertical spacing between these subsections to 32px
- Section top padding: 60-70px
- Section bottom padding: 60-70px
- Result: A more compact, elegant dashboard that matches hero width


SECTION 3: "Before vs. After: Real Client Results"

Current state: Two-column comparison that may be stretching too wide.

Fixes needed:
- Apply standard max-width container (same as hero)
- This constrains the overall section width to ~70% of screen
- The two cards (red "Before" and green "After") sit within this container:
  * Each card naturally becomes narrower due to container constraint
  * Also reduce card height by 15-20% through reduced internal padding
  * Reduce padding above and below metrics within each card
  * Scale proportionally - not just height but width as cards adapt to narrower container
- Section top padding: 60px
- Section bottom padding: 60px
- Keep text hierarchy and readability intact while achieving proportional sizing


SECTION 4: "How We Turn Intent Into Authority" Process Framework

Current state: Four process cards stretched very wide across screen, taking excessive space.

Fixes needed:
- This section is currently TOO WIDE (approaching 100% width)
- Apply standard max-width container to match hero width
- This constrains the 4-card layout to ~70% of screen width:
  * Cards automatically become narrower due to container constraint
  * Also reduce card height by 15-20% through internal padding reduction
  * Reduce horizontal gaps between cards slightly (if any) to maintain comfortable spacing within narrower container
  * Scale the connecting dashed line proportionally
- Reduce vertical spacing:
  * Gap between section heading and cards: 32-40px
  * Section top padding: 60px
  * Section bottom padding: 60px
- Result: A proportionally smaller, more elegant process visualization that matches overall page width


SECTION 5: Input Field + CTA ("Want to see how your category leaders perform?")

Fixes needed:
- Apply standard max-width container
- Keep this section at the same comfortable width as hero
- Maintain current spacing and sizing as this appears well-proportioned


MEASUREMENT & VALIDATION:

After implementation, verify:
1. All sections have identical max-width (matching hero section at ~70% of viewport)
2. Equal left and right margins on all sections creating a clean vertical alignment
3. The three main sections (Analytics Dashboard + Before/After + Process) together fit within approximately 1800-2200px vertical space
4. No section feels cramped - readability and visual hierarchy are maintained
5. The page feels cohesive with consistent "content column" running down the center
6. All text remains readable at scaled sizes


KEY PRINCIPLE:
Scale sections down proportionally (both width AND height) like applying a uniform zoom-out, rather than squeezing only vertical or horizontal dimensions. The goal is elegant, consistent sizing that matches your hero section's established width while reducing overall page length.

Do NOT change copy, colors, or core design elements. This is purely a proportional scaling and width-consistency optimization.
